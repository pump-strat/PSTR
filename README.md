## 🚀 The First Strategic PUMP Treasury on Solana

PSTR introduces a revolutionary and the first ever treasury mechanism that accumulates PUMP tokens to create a reserve-backed stabilization engine for the PSTR token ecosystem.

### Key Features

- ✅ **90% Treasury Allocation** - Systematic PUMP accumulation building the largest strategic reserve
- ✅ **10% Liquidity Commitment** - Ever-expanding liquidity moat for price stability
- ✅ **Automated Stabilization** - Smart intervention system deploys reserves during drawdowns
- ✅ **Dual Ecosystem Support** - Benefits from PUMP growth while protecting PSTR holders
- ✅ **100% Transparent** - On-chain verification of all treasury operations

## 📊 How It Works

### Treasury Architecture (90%)

PSTR continuously accumulates PUMP tokens through systematic purchases. This Strategic Reserve serves as a dynamic stabilization engine that automatically intervenes when PSTR experiences significant price compression.

**Intervention Thresholds:**
-5-20% price compression → Deploy 10% of reserves
Calculation: Treasury Value × Tier 1 Percentage = Deployment Amount
Expected Impact: ~(Deployment Amount ÷ Market Cap) × Recovery Multiplier
20-30% price compression → Deploy 25% of reserves
Calculation: Treasury Value × Tier 2 Percentage = Deployment Amount
Expected Impact: ~(Deployment Amount ÷ Market Cap) × Recovery Multiplier
30%+ price compression → Deploy 40% of reserves
Calculation: Treasury Value × Tier 3 Percentage = Deployment Amount
Expected Impact: ~(Deployment Amount ÷ Market Cap) × Recovery Multiplier

### Liquidity Architecture (10%)

10% of all inflows are permanently allocated to PSTR liquidity pools, creating deep, stable markets that reduce slippage and attract institutional participation.
